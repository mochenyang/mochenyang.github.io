# RESEARCH INTERESTS

My research aims at deriving insights and strategies to facilitate interactions and transactions among various actors in IT-enabled platforms and markets. In particular, I combine econometric analyses, randomized experiments, survey methods, and machine learning to study the relationships between digital content and engagement behaviors in business pages on social media. In addition, I use mathematical modeling and simulation methods to design theoretically robust and computationally efficient technology artifacts and mechanisms that facilitate economic efficiency and decision making in complex markets.
