I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Information and Decision Sciences](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/departments/information-decision-sciences-department) at [Carlson School of Management](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/), [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/).

My main research revolves around the topic of algorithmic decision-making and consists of three connected streams. In the first stream of work, I study the problem of designing theoretically robust and computationally efficient algorithms and strategies to support decision-making in information-intensive marketplaces. In the second stream of work, I examine the antecedents of algorithmic decision-making as well as its impact on decision quality, fairness, and privacy. In the third stream of work, I design novel approaches to draw robust statistical inference with variables generated by machine learning algorithms.

Before joining Carlson, I was an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Operations and Decision Technologies](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/departments/operations-decision-technologies/index.cshtml) at [Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iu.edu/), Indiana University. I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Information and Decision Sciences](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/degrees/phd/areas-concentration/information-and-decision-sciences/information-decision-sciences) at Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota. My advisors are [Yuqing Ren](http://www.chingren.com/) and [Gediminas Adomavicius](http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/). My dissertation studies the user-generated content and associated user engagement behavior on company-managed social media pages. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Information Systems and Information Management from the [School of Economics and Management](http://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn).
