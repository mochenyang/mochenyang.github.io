I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Information and Decision Sciences ([IDSc](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/degrees/phd/areas-concentration/information-and-decision-sciences/information-decision-sciences){:target="_blank"}) at Carlson School of Mangement, University of Minnesota. 

My research aims at deriving insights and strategies to facilitate interactions and transactions among various actors in IT-enabled platforms and markets. I study questions in two broad domains: (1) digital content and engagement behaviors on social media platforms, and (2) computational design for complex market mechanisms. First, in my dissertation research, I investigate the relationship between digital content and engagement behaviors on social media brand pages, and the resulting challenges and opportunities for the organizations. Second, I study the problem of designing theoretically robust and computationally efficient information technology artifacts and mechanisms, in order to facilitate participantsâ€™ decision making as well as the economic efficiency in complex markets.

I obtained my bachelor's degree in Information Systems Management from the [School of Economics and Management](http://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}.
